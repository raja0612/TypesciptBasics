compile ts file

npx tsc filename


configure type script

npm i -D typescript

npx tsc --init
this will generate tsconfig.json file with default ts compiler options.


package.json
add "build": "tsc" under scripts section

when you run npm run build , it will fetch the configurations from tsconfig.json
and compile ts files


run ts compiler in watch mode
npx tsc -w 

nodemon
it is used to run js files.

npm i -D nodemon

npx nodemon js file

by default nodemon runs in watch mode

to specify which folder should watch

npx nodemon -w foldername

npx nodemon -w dist dist/index.js

run nodemon in quite mode
npx nodemon -w dist -q dist/index.js


run ts compiler and nodemon in watch mode in concurrently


npm i -D concurrently


npx concurrently "tsc -w" "nodemon -w dist -q dist/index.js"


npx concurrently -n COMPILER, NODEMON -c yellow, blue "tsc -w" "nodemon -w dist -q dist/index.js"

both tsc and nodemon run concurrently, if anyone fails, we should terminate both process
so we use below commannd -k



 "dev": "concurrently -k -n COMPILER,NODEMON -c yellow,blue \"tsc -w\" \"nodemon -w dist -q dist/index.js\""

 -k - kill if tsc or nodemon fails

 -n - names of processes

 -c - colors of process on console
